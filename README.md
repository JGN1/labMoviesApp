Additional items as part of Assignment

Additional actor specific API calls in tmdb-api.js
Components:
    actorCard
    ActorDetails
    actorList
    headerActor
    templateActorPage
    templateActorsListPage
    actorFilmography
    actorFilmCard

Actors Pages:
    actorDetailsPage.jsx
    popularActors.jsx

Actors Routing:
    Added additional routes in src/index.jsx for actors pages
        <Route path="/actors/profile/:id" element={<ActorDetailsPage/>} />          
        <Route path="/actors/popular" element={<PopularActorsPage/>} />  

Actor Details page includes biography of Actor, photos of actor, and filmography section showing films and movies they are known for.

The filmography section includes film cards that have complex interaction (found this ability in MUI documentation). 
    Clicking on chevron at bottom expands card to show overview. 
    Click on image links to movie details page to see film details. 

Filmography includes combined credits i.e. films and tv shows actor has starred in. The actorFilmography and actorFilmCard components were added to facilitate this.

Enhanced Filter
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Added Enhaced filter on Home screen to allow fileter by year. For this made changes on 
Pages:
    homepage.jsx

Components:
    movieFilterUI
    filterMoviesCard

Incorporated @mui/x-date-pickers from MUI and set to year only date picker.
Had to install following to make work...

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install dayjs --save

Had to add additional function called handleDateChange in the filterMoviesCard component. Datepicker sends value of datepicker instead of event object. This led to errors when the original handleInputUser function called e.preverntDefaults(); 

Additionally I used substring function to extract year from universal timestamp value the date picker returns.

I also moved the Drawer component to right hand side of screen instead of left because when movies filtered down to one  or two, they were hidden behind the drawer.
